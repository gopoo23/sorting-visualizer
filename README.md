# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting-Visualizer : a Web application to visualize different sorting algorithms.

Sorting visualizer is a web application created with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
. This web app is used to visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort etc. Sorting a sequence of items is one of the pillars of Computer Science. This project does not want to teach the theory of sorting algorithms, there are amazing resources, books and courses for this purpose. SORTING-VISUALIZER is for the ones who want to see these algorithms under a different light and hopefully appreciate the processing and brain power behind these pieces of genius that in many ways have changed the way we live.
